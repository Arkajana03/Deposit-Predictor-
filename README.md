## 📊 Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

### 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a **classification model** that predicts whether a bank client will subscribe to a **term deposit** based on demographic, historical, and call-related information. This project simulates a real-world **retail banking** use case and applies data science techniques to optimize marketing strategies.

---

### 🏢 Business Context

Retail banks invest heavily in telemarketing campaigns to sell term deposits—a critical source of their revenue. However, these campaigns are expensive. Therefore, **targeting the right customers** who are most likely to subscribe is crucial for cost-effectiveness.

---

### 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset is split into two files:

* **`train.csv`** – contains labeled data for training the model (with `subscribed` as the target variable).
* **`test.csv`** – contains data to generate predictions using the trained model.
