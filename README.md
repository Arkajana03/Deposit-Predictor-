# Deposit-Predictor-
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, historical, and call-related information. This project simulates a real-world retail banking use case and applies data science techniques to optimize marketing strategies.

### üè¢ Business Context

Retail banks invest heavily in telemarketing campaigns to sell term deposits‚Äîa critical source of their revenue. However, these campaigns are expensive. Therefore, **targeting the right customers** who are most likely to subscribe is crucial for cost-effectiveness.

### üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset is split into two files:

* **`train.csv`** ‚Äì contains labeled data for training the model (with `subscribed` as the target variable).
* **`test.csv`** ‚Äì contains data to generate predictions using the trained model.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visual insights into key features
   * Identify patterns related to subscription

3. **Model Building**

   * Baseline Logistic Regression
   * Ensemble models like Random Forest & XGBoost
   * Evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

4. **Prediction**

   * Predict outcomes on unseen `test.csv` data
   * Save results to a CSV file
